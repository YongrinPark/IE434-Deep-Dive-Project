Forecasting Illinois LMP using Machine Learning and Deep Learning (IE 434 Deep Dive Project)
This repository contains the full implementation, datasets, documentation, and results for the **IE 434 Deep Dive Project** at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  
Our goal was to **forecast hourly Locational Marginal Prices (LMP) for the Illinois Hub** using a combination of traditional machine learning and deep learning models, and to analyze which features most strongly drive LMP behavior.
