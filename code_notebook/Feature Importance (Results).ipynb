Conclusions (based on the results):\n","\n","From the deep-learning notebook:\n","\n","- **Ridge Regression** achieved:\n","  - MAE ≈ **\\$4.19**, RMSE ≈ **\\$9.19**, R² ≈ **0.8977**.\n","- A baseline **Dense Neural Network** achieved:\n","  - MAE ≈ **\\$10.04**, RMSE ≈ **\\$12.46**, R² ≈ **0.8119**.\n","- Multiple **LSTM** and **GRU** experiments with expanding windows, PCA, and outlier controls reached **R² in the 0.2–0.25 range** on the test set.\n","\n","The feature importance analysis makes these patterns easier to understand:\n","\n","1. **Importance of current hub prices**\n","\n","   Both coefficient and permutation importance show that a **small set of hub prices** (especially `act_MICHIGAN.HUB`, `da_ILLINOIS.HUB`, `da_INDIANA.HUB`, and other nearby hubs) explain most of the variance in Illinois LMP.\n","\n","   This means the problem is largely about learning a **cross-sectional mapping** from current hub and load conditions to the Illinois LMP, rather than about remembering long sequences of past values.\n","\n","2. **Short-term history and load help, but are secondary**\n","\n","   Features like `lmp_act_lag_1h`, `lmp_act_roll24`, and the load variables (`ActualLoad`, `ClearedLoad`, `ForecastedLoad`) improve the predictions a little bit but do not change model performance.\n","\n","   This explains why:\n","   - Ridge, which is linear and uses these features directly, already achieves **R² ≈ 0.90**.\n","   - Adding more deep-learning capacity does not automatically give better results.\n","\n","3. **Why LSTM/GRU struggled?**\n","\n","   LSTM and GRU were designed to use *long temporal dependencies* in sequences.  \n","   However, the feature importance analysis shows that **long historical data are not where the data is useful**:\n","\n","   - The most important information is **already used** in the **current-hour hub prices and load**.\n","   - When the model tries to learn from long sequences, it tends to:\n","     - Overfit noise,\n","     - Struggle with high volatility and outliers,\n","     - Fail to significantly improve over the simple cross-sectional mapping learned by Ridge.\n","\n","   This is consistent with the low R² values observed for LSTM/GRU in the deep-learning notebook.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 5. Key Takeaways\n","\n","- The Illinois LMP forecasting task in this project is majorly influenced by a **small number of current hub price features**, supported by load and short-term history.\n","- A simple, well-regularized **Ridge Regression** model is sufficient to capture almost all the useful signal in the engineered feature set.\n","- More complex sequence models (LSTM/GRU) do not yield better performance unless the problem is re-framed to genuinely depend on long-term temporal structure.\n","\n","In other words, the **feature importance results fully support the model conclusions** from the deep-learning notebook:\n","> Invest in good **current-hour features** and simple models, rather than in very complex sequence architectures for this particular LMP dataset.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"plrlWPDmtggz"}}]}
